# HousePricePrediction
Predicting the prices of Melbourne's houses using decision tree and random forest.

Splitting the data to train and test set, I trained the model with training set employing decision tree and random forest in scikit-learn library, and evaluated the predictions of these models on test set by comparing the Mean Absolute Error of each model.
